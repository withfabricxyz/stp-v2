/// @dev Library for reward tracking and distribution
///
///      This library is designed to issues shares to holders based on a multiplier calculated
///      via a reward curve multiplied by allocated currency. Each holder effectively has a percentage
///      of the total reward pool which allows them to claim rewards (currency) based on their
///      share of the pool and time of issuance.
///
///      The reward curve is defined by a set of parameters which determine the multiplier at any given time.
///
///      Because the reward curves can be flat or decaying, earlier holders may have a higher multiplier
///      than later holders. This is useful for incentivizing early participation in a protocol.
///
///      Additionally, there are slashing (burning) mechanisms which can be used to reduce the total
///      number of shares. With STP, holders are slashable if the creator allows it at deployment AND
///      the holder is no longer an active subscriber. Holders are paid out their rewards before losing shares.
///
///      Note: Due to the nature of curves and allocation, the order of issuance matters. Example:
///      - Contract deployed
///      - Alice allocates 100 tokens and now owns 100% of the shares
///        - Alice has 100 claimable tokens
///      - Bob allocates 100 tokens and now owns 1/2 of the shares, alice 1/2
///        - Alice has 150 claimable tokens
///        - Bob has 50 claimable tokens
///      - Charlie allocates 100 tokens and now owns 1/3 of the shares, alice 1/3, bob 1/3
///        - Alice has ~183.33 claimable tokens
///        - Bob has ~83.33 claimable tokens
///        - Charlie has ~33.33 claimable tokens
///      - Creator issues 100 shares to doug, all parties now own 1/4 of the shares
///        - Alice has ~183.33 claimable tokens
///        - Bob has ~83.33 claimable tokens
///        - Charlie has ~33.33 claimable tokens
///        - Doug has ~0 claimable tokens
